# Package List
This repository consists of several ROS packages
- **nuturtle_description** - package that vizualizes the 4 turtlebot3 burgers based on the turtlebot3 burger model from the turtlebot3 repo. 
- **turtlelib** - C++ library that contains the geometry and SE(2) geometry classes and svg classes for vizualization of transformations. 
- **nusim** - package that simulates the turtlebot3 burgers in a 2D environment with walls and cylindrical obstacles.
- **turtle_control** - package that contains the odometry and controller nodes for the nusim simulation and for the real turtlebot3 burgers.
